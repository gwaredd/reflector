          given element

0.3  Mon Apr  16 10:20:04 2001
        - fixed children() bugs
        - fixed name() accessor within 'foreach ($obj->children)' loops

          Ahmavuo)

0.41  Fri Aug 24 2001
        - changed to allow parsing without separate XML::Parser object
        - changed to handle empty elements properly; thanks to Thomas Ziehmer
        - changed convert() implementation to allow zero values and some flow 
          enhancements; thanks to Eric Kolve

0.5  Wed Jan 23 2002
	- added XML::SimpleObject::LibXML providing the same interface using 
	  XML::LibXML; it's faster and uses the libxml DOM methods rather 
	  than iterating the tree twice. See the separate perldoc for this
	  module.

	- fixed Makefile.PL to include dependencies

0.52  Tue Mar 6 2003
	- applied patch to SimpleObject.pm to permit inheritance (thanks to 
          Cliff Stanford)
	- fixed changes with libxml 1.53 to work with constant XML_TEXT_NODE
        - added XML::SimpleObject::Enhanced.pm (need to document)

0.53  Tue Mar 6 2003
	- bad dist fix
