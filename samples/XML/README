DESCRIPTION

This is a small and simple package that takes the output of an XML parser
and gives simple methods for accessing the structure of an XML document. It 
is very lightweight, but provides the simplest access to an XML document 
possible. It does not subclass XML::Parser or XML::LibXML; rather, it is meant 
to serve purely as an object struct for an outgoing tree.

I originally wrote the module as an example of parsing without handlers.

REQUIREMENTS

You need either XML::Parser (for XML::SimpleObject) or XML::LibXML (for 
XML::SimpleObject::LibXML).

Tested on Linux, FreeBSD, and Win32 under perl5.6.0 and perl5.6.1.

INSTALLATION

  (cd LibXML/; if installing the LibXML version)
  perl Makefile.PL
  make 
  make install

Then look at ex.pl. That pretty much sums up the functionality.
