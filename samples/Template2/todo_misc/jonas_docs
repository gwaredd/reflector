http://www.tt2.org/tpc5/tt2/intro/tdirs.html =~ s/outut/output/


The intro/vdirs.html and intro/tdirs.html is a little confusing.  All
those diffrent words with no explanation to why they are necessary.
And it may not be celar what it means process a template with
localised varables.

I think one could get the impression that a lot of those directives
could be skiped, since many of them do similar things.  Examples of
their use would be good.


***

interface/ttreecfg.html : All these absolute paths feels wrong.  Why
not just define the relationship between the config file and the base,
and then define the other files in relation to the base dir?
Ok.  That's not a comment on the tutorial.  But the first thing I
would do would be to try relative URIs.  You should at least comment
on that.

It would be nice to do:

  etc/ttree.cfg 

        # ttree directory/file options
        base = ..
        src  = src
        dest = html
        lib  = lib
        lib  = /home/abw/tt2/templates
           .
           .
           .
        define  dir = .
        define  url = /~abw/tpc5
        pre_process = config


And you could go with almost no required configuration.
I also think that it should be easier for the generated html pages to
use relative paths.  You shouldn't have to know the base URL. (And
that would result in no need to touch the config file at all.)  This
is important since it makes it easier to develop the site in one place
and deploy it in another place.

***

interface/process.html

I understand the notes. But I think the '$' explanation came out
confusing.  Try to explan that there is no template called 'template',
but htere is a *magic variable* called template.  And the use of '$'
to use variables inside strings...

***

interface/splash.html

This is also confusing.  "PROCESS html/header" says to me that it will
process the file html/header, but that file is in the html directory;
the directory there the result should be placed.  (Maby explaining
where this template is located?)

The WRAPPER example also needs an explanation. By now, I guess that
many has forgotten what WRAPPER does.  And the [% title %] should be
indented!

The END tag can easily lead the mind to "This is the end of the
template. Stop processing now."  And what leads to that you think of
WRAPPER as a standalone directive, followed by the [% title %] thing,
all by itself.  And then the template ends with END...  (Repetition of
the basics maby?)

And what is the value of $title?  Is it the value it got in the
PROCESS tag?  That doesn't sound like localized variables.  I think it
should be explained...

***

content/generator.html and content/skeleton.html

Some illustration of the relationship between these two is needed.
Maby mention the two files ( src/product/index.html and
lib/product/page ) on the first page.  Or some sort of diagram of how
the pages are built.

***

content/viewfiles.html

I would like to see the resulting page here.  It looks like there is a
name and price template missing.  Or is there a default view template?

I would like to see the whole process in one page.  data ->
main_template -> products -> product -> name.

***


And thats all.  The rest is good.


I would have send these comments the same day.  But some part of the
network stopped me from reaching tt2.org... (A problem that lasted
more than a day.)
